Amazon Price Tracker (Written in Python)

Description

This is a script used to scrap through amazon website and email a user when an item
of interest has reached below your price cap.

new gmail account for this purpose.
   
2. Set your email and password.

3. Set the recipient email.

4. Run the script.

5. Paste the url of your item.

6. Enter the price cap.
